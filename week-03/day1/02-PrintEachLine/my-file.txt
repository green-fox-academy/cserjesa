Background
David A. Stewart invited Candy Dulfer, who had not previously released any of her material, to play the saxophone on this instrumental. The single became a major hit and stayed at the number one position for five weeks in the Netherlands. Because of this success, the single was also released in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States where it became a hit as well, reaching number six in the UK and even rising to number 11 in the tough U.S. market. The success of this instrumental encouraged Dulfer to compose music for her own album, which she titled Saxuality.

Recording
According to Candy's father Hans Dulfer on Dutch radio, the recording was done in just one take, actually a jam session, and at that time not meant to be released. This jam session was done at the end of a day of recording for the movie De Kassière, and Dave Stewart later decided to release this as a single.[1]
