# Stories

## Print usage

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  When the application is ran without any arguments
 -  Then it should print the usage information

```
Command Line Todo application
=============================

Command line arguments:
 -l   Lists all the tasks
 -a   Adds a new task
 -r   Removes an task
 -c   Completes an task
```

## List tasks

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And the file where you store your data
 -  And a task with the description `Walk the dog` stored in the file
 -  And a task with the description `Buy milk` stored in the file
 -  And a task with the description `Do homework` stored in the file
 -  When the application is ran with `-l` argument
 -  Then it should print the tasks that are stored in the file
 -  And it should add numbers before each

```
1 -  Walk the dog
2 -  Buy milk
3 -  Do homework
```

## Empty list

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And the file where you store your data
 -  And the file has 0 task
 -  When the application is ran with `-l` argument
 -  Then it should show a message like this: `No todos for today! :)`

## Add new task

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  When the application is ran with the `-a "Feed the monkey"` argument
 -  Then it should add a new task with the description *Feed the monkey*

## Add new task error handling

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  When the application is ran with the `-a` argument
 -  Then it should show an error message like: `Unable to add: no task provided`

## Remove task

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And the file where you store your data
 -  And the file has at least 2 tasks
 -  When the application is ran with the `-r 2` argument
 -  Then it should remove the second task from the file

## Remove task error handling

### Handle no given index 

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory 
 -  When the application is ran with the `-r` argument
 -  Then it should show an error message like: `Unable to remove: no index provided`

### Handle out of bound index

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And the file where you store your data
 -  And the file has less than 20 tasks
 -  When the application is ran with the `-r 20` argument
 -  Then it should show an error message like: `Unable to remove: index is out of bound`

### Handle invalid type of index

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  When the application is ran with the `-r apple` argument
 -  Then it should show an error message like: `Unable to remove: index is not a number`

## Argument error handling

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  When the application is ran with an unsupported argument *(eg. `get`)*
 -  Then it should show an error message like: `Unsupported argument`
 -  And it should print the usage information

## Check task

### With index

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And the file where you store your data
 -  And the file has at least 2 tasks
 -  When the application is ran with the `-c 2` argument
 -  Then it should check the second task from the file

### With `-l` argument

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And a undone task with the description `Walk the dog` stored in the file
 -  And a done task with the description `Buy milk` stored in the file
 -  And a undone task with the description `Do homework` stored in the file
 -  When the application is ran with `-l` argument
 -  Then it should print the tasks that are stored in the file

### Handle out of bound index

 -  Given the terminal opened in the project directory
 -  And the file where you store your data
 -  And the file has less than 20 tasks
 -  When the application is ran with the `-c 20` argument
 -  Then it should show an error message like: `Unable to check: index is out of bound`

### Handle invalid type of index
